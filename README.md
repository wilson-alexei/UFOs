# UFOs
Building a table using data stored in a JavaScript array and creating filters to make this table fully dynamic and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing

## Overview 
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. With this addition, it will enhance our webpage so that we can filter UFO sightings on multiple criterias to display the needed results from the datasets. We will be utilizing `HTML` and `Javascript` through `Visual Studio Code` and working with JSON datasets.
